### Abstract

> The means with which entrepreneurs create and capture value can be difficult to get a comprehensive picture of. Looking at the tools they use can offer insights, and in this context, the book “The Lean Startup” by Eric Ries has received a tremendous amount of attention. Supposedly, many entrepreneurs have read the book and may have followed his advice. Hence, we investigate the merits and characteristics of the methods detailed by Ries through a comparison with leading theories and empirical evidence found in the scientific literature. The results indicate that overall the methods find considerable backing and can in parts be recognized under already established constructs. Heavy use of effectuation-logic is evident throughout the book, with a clear and explicit emphasis on experimentation over long- term planning. The paper closes with a discussion of the possible broader implications of the methods and effectuation, including the potential impact on corporate strategy.

## A Theory of Entrepreneuring

### Summary

This paper proposes a theory of "entrepreneuring" as a processes of solution discovery - one which is most likely to be hindered by the cognitive biases of entrepreneurs themselves.

### Abstract

> This paper develops theory for the organization and governance of value-creating search. While there is broad agreement in both strategy and entrepreneurship that search strategies are deeply connected with value creation, surprisingly little research considers which strategies to design and enact, in which sequence, the tools to employ, or how to structure decision rights concerning those choices. The extant work on value creating search in both entrepreneurship and strategy also tends to emphasize the context in which search occurs, with less attention paid to cognitive and psychological challenges associated with the process. Our approach suggests that corruption of the search process through psychological and cognitive bias is the critical factor that constrains and potentially severely limits entrepreneurial success. Our main finding is a prediction of discriminative alignment between different types of search needs, which we represent as a taxonomy, and governance mechanisms that effectively counter search biases and reduce ex ante and ex post search costs.

### Abstract

> We examine how investors’ tolerance for failure impacts the types of projects they are willing to fund. We show that actions that reduce short term accountability and thus encourage agents to experiment more simultaneously reduce the level of experimentation financial backers are willing to fund. Failure tolerance has an equilibrium price that increases in the level of experimentation. More experimental projects that don’t generate enough to pay the price cannot be started. In fact, an endogenous equilibrium can arise in which all competing financiers choose to be failure tolerant in the attempt to attract entrepreneurs, leaving no capital to fund the most radical, experimental projects in the economy. The tradeoff between failure tolerance and a sharp guillotine help explain when and where radical innovation occurs.

### Abstract

> Based on recent findings concerning the best performing startups, we develop a model of Schumpeterian entrepreneurship in which founders exploit ideas they learned through their employment. The model yields distinctive implications about how labor market experience and earnings at work influence the probability of a worker becoming an entrepreneur, earnings as an entrepreneur relative to paid work, and persistence in entrepreneurship. These implications are tested using data on the earnings of scientists and engineers, which are common founders of high growth startups. The sample is pared down to those that worked in and founded businesses related to their education in order to isolate the best candidates for Schumpeterian entrepreneurship.

## A Price Theory of Silicon Valley

### Summary

A price-based theory of when engineers choose to join startups is used to predict VC investment and the "minimum quality" of startup ideas that can be funded, along with engineer wages.

### Abstract

> I develop a model of Silicon Valley engineer labor and venture capital (VC) markets. Software engineers choose between joining an established software company or founding a venture-backed startup. In equilibrium, they are indifferent between
entrepreneurship and employment. The model predicts equilibrium markets wages, the terms of VC investments (i.e., the fraction of equity retained by the entrepreneur) and the minimum “quality” of the ideas pursued by startups, as represented by the VC
funding “standard”. This funding standard I inversely related to the number of new startups per period. When direct startup costs fall—e.g., as a result of technological advances or lowered interest rates—engineer wages rise and entrepreneurs can obtain better terms from VCs; VC funding standards drop, increasing the number of startups. Increases in the supply of engineers reduce wages, decrease retained equity and lower the VC funding standard. Increases in the supply of ideas raise wages, increase retained equity and raise the VC funding standard. Increases in demand in the product market for software raise wages, raise retained equity and lower the VC funding standard.

### Abstract

> Do networks plentiful in ideas provide early stage startups with performance advantages? On the one hand, network positions that provide access to a multitude of ideas are thought to increase team performance. On the other hand, research on network formation argues that such positional advantages should be fleeting as entrepreneurs both strategically compete for the most valuable network positions and form relationships with others who have similar characteristics and abilities. I embed a field experiment in a three-week-long startup bootcamp to test if networks that are plentiful in ideas lead to performance advantages. Using detailed data from the bootcamp’s custom-designed learning management platform, I find support for the first hypothesis. Teams with networks more plentiful in ideas receive better peer evaluations and more crowdfunding page views. I find little evidence that entrepreneurs actively build networks to others who could have provided a greater quantity of information and ideas. Instead, entrepreneurs seek feedback from those they have collaborated with in the past or who share similar ascriptive characteristics. These findings provide first-order evidence for the importance of knowledge spillovers within bootcamps, incubators, and accelerators. Furthermore, the findings provide a potential explanation for the durability of idea and information-based network advantages.

### Abstract

> Entrepreneurship is characterized by high failure rates and extreme uncertainty. In light of this, entrepreneurs’ learning about potential returns at an early stage is essential to their entry and allocation of resources. This paper uses the crowdfunding market to provide direct micro-level evidence on entrepreneurial learning. I find that entrepreneurs update beliefs based on feedbacks from the crowd in ways consistent with a simple Bayesian learning model, placing more weight on information with relatively higher precision. Moreover, entrepreneurs make entry and project choice decisions based on what they learned. Over time, learning improves an entrepreneur’s funding outcomes and reduces her likelihood of switching projects. I further establish the learning advantage of crowdfunding using local housing price movements and small business loan supply shocks as changes to the relative cost of crowdfunding vis-à-vis bank borrowing. I find that, as crowdfunding becomes relatively more costly, entrepreneurs choosing crowdfunding face higher uncertainty ex-ante and engage in more learning ex-post. My paper uncovers a new role of crowdfunding: the facilitation of learning. It suggests that feedback from financial markets, traditionally only available to listed firms, can become accessible to entrepreneurs of new ventures as early- stage financing is disintermediated by the involvement of the crowd.

### Abstract

> I present a model of technology entrepreneurship in which “engineers” choose to either found a startup as an entrepreneur, pursuing a single business idea—obtaining seed funding from VCs in exchange for equity—or join an established startup as an employee. The model predicts the number of startups formed and their success probability. It also predicts the wages of engineers, the share of equity retained by founders, the fraction of engineers pursuing entrepreneurship, and the profits of successful startups. The model characterizes the total output of the entrepreneurial system and the social value of the marginal entrepreneurial venture.

### Abstract

> Entrepreneurial passion has gained credence in recent years in explaining entrepreneurial efforts, yet examination of the dynamics of this emotion and its effects on venture growth is still in its infancy. Building on the literature on entrepreneurial motivation and entrepreneurial passion, we develop and test a model of entrepreneurial passion, goals, and venture growth. We utilize path analysis on a two-wave sample of founders from 122 high technology firms. We find direct positive effects of passion for developing on venture growth and an indirect positive effect mediated by goal commitment, but not goal challenge. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

## Understanding the value proposition as a cocreated claim

### Summary

Entrepreneurs' presentation of their "value proposition" encompasses both a product-focussed ("goods-dominant") logic, and a "service-dominant logic" centered on how the innovation will co-create value with stakeholders.

### Abstract

> In this paper, we examine five cases of technology commercialization in terms of how entrepreneurs advance a specific kind of claim: the value proposition. The value proposition can describe the characteristics of the innovation itself (Goods- Dominant Logic) or propose how the innovation will co-create value with stakeholders (Service-Dominant Logic); in the examined cases, the value proposition transitions between these two “logics,” addressing different needs in the ongoing argument. We conclude by discussing the needs that each “logic” serves and the implications for better understanding entrepreneurship communication.

### Abstract

> This paper seeks to apply a processual thinking of subjectivity in the study of “becoming entrepreneur”. Design/methodology/approach – Through analysing Foucault's idea of subjectification, by the help of Deleuze's comments and elaborations, the paper seeks to clarify one opacity in entrepreneurship research – the “vanishing presence” of the entrepreneur in processual studies of entrepreneurship. To avoid performative contradiction, the paper seeks to contextualise this attempt in guiding principles provided by process philosophy. Findings – Without a process view, “the subject” as entity and self-constitutive *res cogitans* (thinking thing or mind) will take priority over subjectification, and the paper will loose the possibility to think and study the process of becoming-subject in its own terms. Originality/value – Understanding entrepreneurship as organisation-creation, the paper here adds a processual conceptualisation to the study of such processes by focusing on the arrangements (*agancements* [sic] as Deleuze called this, or *dispositifs* as Foucault preferred to use) in which subjectification into “entrepreneur” happens.

### Abstract

> This article contributes to the interplay between international entrepreneurship, innovation networks, and early internationalization research by emphasizing the need to conceptualize and introduce a new type of firm: the lean global startup. It discussed two different paths in linking the lean startup and born-global internationalization strategies. The first path refers to generic lean startups that have undertaken a rapid internationalization strategy (i.e., lean-to-global startups). The second path refers to startups that have started operating on global scale since their inception and adopted the lean startup approach by seamlessly synergizing their global and lean product development activities. The article emphasizes several aspects that could be used as part of the theoretical foundation for conceptualizing lean global startups as a special new type of firm: i) the emergent nature of their business models, including the challenges of partnership development on a global scale; ii) the inherently relational nature of the global resource allocation processes; iii) the integration of the entrepreneurial, effectuation, and global marketing perspectives; iv) the need to deal with a high degree of uncertainty, including the uncertainty associated with cross-border business operations; and v) linking the ex-ante characteristics of lean startups with the ex-post characteristics of born-global firms in order to develop a technology adop- tion marketing perspective that considers the “crossing the chasm” process as a successful entry into a global market niche.

### Abstract

> Companies developing new products often end up addressing different customers in other markets with products they didn't envision when the original product development was initiated. This pivoting is more apparent in start-ups developing their very first products and searching for their initial product-market fit. Using five case studies, this article investigates the role of product iterations in finding product-market fit and the potential role played by venture capital (VC) in this process. The authors find that impact of VC funding on product iterations is diverse and the sooner product iterations happen (if needed), the better. VC funding usually provides adequate financial tolerance to explore multiple options toward ultimately validating a tangible product-market fit that enables scaling and potential high growth.

### Abstract

> This paper empirically examines and provides causal evidence on how startup-investor involvement influences CEO turnover, and its performance implications. Using a large dataset of investors, startups, executives and their characteristics, we focus on how the participation of more prominent investors affects CEO replacement in startup companies, identifying the conditions associated with these leadership transitions, and relating CEO replacement to ex post financial and innovative performance. By implementing a Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) algorithm, we generate causal evidence showing not only that prominent-investor participation increases the incidence of CEO replacement, but that these successor CEOs are drawn overwhelmingly from one pool: Outside candidates with previous CEO experience at other investor-backed startups. We provide additional causal evidence demonstrating that CEO replacement produces superior company performance, and that this performance effect is enhanced when the new CEO comes from outside the company, and boosted even more when the individual has prior startup CEO experience. We demonstrate that these performance-increasing effects are driven specifically by CEO replacements caused by prominent-investor participation, and that the involvement of prominent investors produces large independent performance premiums in startups.

### Abstract

> We test in the laboratory how entrepreneurs’ skill perceptions influence the design of financing and advising contracts. Our theoretical framework proposes that self-confident entrepreneurs prefer issuing debt whereas low self-confident ones prefer equity which induces strong investor assistance. The prevalence of overconfidence makes investors more reluctant to accept debt offers and constrains self-confident entrepreneurs to finance through mixed securities. Experimental results show that self-confident entrepreneurs issue more debt-like securities and receive less assistance. We also show that entrepreneurs learn not to offer pure debt and that initial ignorance of their own skills reinforces entrepreneurs’ ability to learn through risky choices.

### Abstract

> In this article, we critically evaluate what the existing research shows regarding the individual determinants of entrepreneurship. We begin by documenting a set of facts that seem to pose a challenge for interpretations of entrepreneurship based on the standard expected utility framework. Drawing on research in behavioral economics we then review three sets of possible interpretations — risk aversion, overconfidence, and non-pecuniary, taste-based factors — for understanding the empirical facts related to the entry into, and persistence in entrepreneurship. The central thesis of this article is that while all these candidate explanations have merit and can account for some aspects of the facts above, there is little evidence of a “smoking gun” that can completely account for all the puzzling patterns we observe.

## Financing Risk and Innovation

### Summary

A model that demonstrates why some places, times and industries should be associated with a greater degree of experimentation by investors, based on the influence of financing risk on VCs' decision making: extremely novel technologies may need ‘hot’ financial markets to get through the initial period of discovery or diffusion.

### Abstract

> We provide a model of investment into new ventures that demonstrates why some places, times and industries should be associated with a greater degree of experimentation by investors. Investors respond to financing risk – a forecast of limited future funding – by modifying their focus to finance less innovative firms. Potential shocks to the supply of capital create the need for increased upfront financing, but this protection lowers the real option value of the new venture. In equilibrium, financing risk disproportionately impacts innovative ventures with the greatest real option value. We propose that extremely novel technologies may need ‘hot’ financial markets to get through the initial period of discovery or diffusion.

### Abstract

> We examine the relationship between house prices and entrepreneurship using micro data from the US Census Bureau. Increases in house prices are often thought to drive entrepreneurship through unlocking the collateral channel for bank loans, but this interpretation is challenged by worries regarding omitted variable biases (e.g., rising local demand) or wealth e§ects (i.e., that people with more valuable homes are more likely to enter entrepreneurship for reasons other than access to collateral). We construct an empirical environment that utilizes very localized price changes, exploits variations in initial home values across residents in the same zip code, and embeds multiple comparisons (e.g., owners vs. renters, homestead exemption laws by state). For the United States during the 2000-2004 period, the link of home prices to the rate of entrepreneurship through home equity channels is modest in economic magnitude. This is despite a focus on a time period that experienced the largest concentration of US home price growth over the last two decades. Even when we do connect home equity to entrepreneurship, part of the effect is linked to an increased demand for entrepreneurship. While housing collateral plays a role in the entry that we observe, it does not seem to be a major barrier to entrepreneurship in our context.

### Abstract

> Motivated by a significant disconnect between research, teaching and practice regarding the role of strategy in entrepreneurial ventures, this paper develops an integrated framework that defines and delineates the scope of entrepreneurial strategy, clarifies the choices and complementarities that shape entrepreneurial strategy, and proposes a choice-oriented process for implementing entrepreneurial strategy. We take an axiomatic approach, highlighting four interrelated premises: (i) Freedom: there is more than one alternative path by which value can be created and captured from a given idea; (ii) Constraint: resource and strategic constraints prevent the entrepreneur from pursuing more than one of these alternatives at once; (iii) Uncertainty: even after undertaking cost-benefit analysis to deselect some alternatives, there is unresolved uncertainty preventing a ranking of at least two alternatives, and (iv) Learning by Commitment: partial movement down a path to learn more about an option changes both the value of and the information available about alternative paths. Together, these conditions give rise to our central organizing insight, the paradox of entrepreneurship: choosing between equally viable alternative strategic commitments requires knowledge that can only be gained through experimentation and learning of the type that inevitably results in (at least some level) of commitment that forecloses particular strategic options. Entrepreneurial strategy is a choice-oriented approach to overcoming the paradox of entrepreneurship. Specifically, entrepreneurial strategy is the set (or sequence) of choices founders (and their teams) make in order to test a value creation and value capture hypothesis when entrepreneurial experimentation requires partial commitment. This approach yields three principles of entrepreneurial strategy. First, Choice Matters: when learning requires partial commitment, start-ups will not simply be able to optimize by identifying a best approach, but will instead be required to select an alternative that results in leaving equally viable yet conflicting alternatives behind. Second, These Choice Matter: there are specific choices start-ups face – Customers, Technology, Identity, and Competition – where the interplay between experimentation and commitment are salient; a choice- oriented approach yields a reconceptualization of traditional frameworks endemic to teaching and research in these domains. Finally, These Choices Matter Together: structured complementarities and interdependencies among these choices results in the identification of four alternative strategic directions for a given idea. Together, these principles motivate a new class of choice-oriented decision- making tools for entrepreneurs. We highlight one new tool – Test Two, Choose One – that offers a novel approach for how to undertake entrepreneurial decision-making under uncertainty.

### Abstract

> Recent years have seen the emergence of a new institutional form in the entrepreneurial ecosystem: the seed accelerator. These fixed-term, cohort-based, "boot camps" for startups offer educational and mentorship programs for startup founders, exposing them to wide variety of mentors, including former entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, angel investors, and corporate executives; and culminate in a public pitch event, or "demo day," during which the graduating cohort of startup companies pitch their businesses to a large group of potential investors. In practice, accelerator programs are a combination of previously distinct services or functions that were each individually costly for an entrepreneur to find and obtain. The accelerator approach has been widely adopted by private groups, public and government efforts, and by corporations. While proliferation of accelerators is clearly evident, with worldwide estimates of 3000+ programs in existence, research on the role and efficacy of these programs has been limited. In this article, I provide an introduction to the accelerator model and summarize recent evidence on their effects on the regional entrepreneurial environment.
