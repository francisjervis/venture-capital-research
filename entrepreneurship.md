### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> The means with which entrepreneurs create and capture value can be difficult to get a comprehensive picture of. Looking at the tools they use can offer insights, and in this context, the book “The Lean Startup” by Eric Ries has received a tremendous amount of attention. Supposedly, many entrepreneurs have read the book and may have followed his advice. Hence, we investigate the merits and characteristics of the methods detailed by Ries through a comparison with leading theories and empirical evidence found in the scientific literature. The results indicate that overall the methods find considerable backing and can in parts be recognized under already established constructs. Heavy use of effectuation-logic is evident throughout the book, with a clear and explicit emphasis on experimentation over long- term planning. The paper closes with a discussion of the possible broader implications of the methods and effectuation, including the potential impact on corporate strategy.

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> This paper develops theory for the organization and governance of value-creating search. While there is broad agreement in both strategy and entrepreneurship that search strategies are deeply connected with value creation, surprisingly little research considers which strategies to design and enact, in which sequence, the tools to employ, or how to structure decision rights concerning those choices. The extant work on value creating search in both entrepreneurship and strategy also tends to emphasize the context in which search occurs, with less attention paid to cognitive and psychological challenges associated with the process. Our approach suggests that corruption of the search process through psychological and cognitive bias is the critical factor that constrains and potentially severely limits entrepreneurial success. Our main finding is a prediction of discriminative alignment between different types of search needs, which we represent as a taxonomy, and governance mechanisms that effectively counter search biases and reduce ex ante and ex post search costs.

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> We examine how investors’ tolerance for failure impacts the types of projects they are willing to fund. We show that actions that reduce short term accountability and thus encourage agents to experiment more simultaneously reduce the level of experimentation financial backers are willing to fund. Failure tolerance has an equilibrium price that increases in the level of experimentation. More experimental projects that don’t generate enough to pay the price cannot be started. In fact, an endogenous equilibrium can arise in which all competing financiers choose to be failure tolerant in the attempt to attract entrepreneurs, leaving no capital to fund the most radical, experimental projects in the economy. The tradeoff between failure tolerance and a sharp guillotine help explain when and where radical innovation occurs.

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> Based on recent findings concerning the best performing startups, we develop a model of Schumpeterian entrepreneurship in which founders exploit ideas they learned through their employment. The model yields distinctive implications about how labor market experience and earnings at work influence the probability of a worker becoming an entrepreneur, earnings as an entrepreneur relative to paid work, and persistence in entrepreneurship. These implications are tested using data on the earnings of scientists and engineers, which are common founders of high growth startups. The sample is pared down to those that worked in and founded businesses related to their education in order to isolate the best candidates for Schumpeterian entrepreneurship.

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> I develop a model of Silicon Valley engineer labor and venture capital (VC) markets. Software engineers choose between joining an established software company or founding a venture-backed startup. In equilibrium, they are indifferent between
entrepreneurship and employment. The model predicts equilibrium markets wages, the terms of VC investments (i.e., the fraction of equity retained by the entrepreneur) and the minimum “quality” of the ideas pursued by startups, as represented by the VC
funding “standard”. This funding standard I inversely related to the number of new startups per period. When direct startup costs fall—e.g., as a result of technological advances or lowered interest rates—engineer wages rise and entrepreneurs can obtain better terms from VCs; VC funding standards drop, increasing the number of startups. Increases in the supply of engineers reduce wages, decrease retained equity and lower the VC funding standard. Increases in the supply of ideas raise wages, increase retained equity and raise the VC funding standard. Increases in demand in the product market for software raise wages, raise retained equity and lower the VC funding standard.

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> Do networks plentiful in ideas provide early stage startups with performance advantages? On the one hand, network positions that provide access to a multitude of ideas are thought to increase team performance. On the other hand, research on network formation argues that such positional advantages should be fleeting as entrepreneurs both strategically compete for the most valuable network positions and form relationships with others who have similar char- acteristics and abilities. I embed a field experiment in a three-week-long startup bootcamp to test if networks that are plentiful in ideas lead to performance advantages. Using detailed data from the bootcamp’s custom-designed learning management platform, I find support for the first hypothesis. Teams with networks more plentiful in ideas receive better peer evaluations and more crowdfunding page views. I find little evidence that entrepreneurs actively build net- works to others who could have provided a greater quantity of information and ideas. Instead, entrepreneurs seek feedback from those they have collaborated with in the past or who share similar ascriptive characteristics. These findings provide first-order evidence for the importance of knowledge spillovers within bootcamps, incubators, and accelerators. Furthermore, the find- ings provide a potential explanation for the durability of idea and information-based network advantages.

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> Entrepreneurship is characterized by high failure rates and extreme uncertainty. In light of this, entrepreneurs’ learning about potential returns at an early stage is essential to their entry and allocation of resources. This paper uses the crowdfunding market to provide direct micro-level evidence on entrepreneurial learning. I find that entrepreneurs update beliefs based on feedbacks from the crowd in ways consistent with a simple Bayesian learning model, placing more weight on information with relatively higher precision. Moreover, entrepreneurs make entry and project choice decisions based on what they learned. Over time, learning improves an entrepreneur’s funding outcomes and reduces her likelihood of switching projects. I further establish the learning advantage of crowdfunding using local housing price movements and small business loan supply shocks as changes to the relative cost of crowdfunding vis-à-vis bank borrowing. I find that, as crowdfunding becomes relatively more costly, entrepreneurs choosing crowdfunding face higher uncertainty ex-ante and engage in more learning ex-post. My paper uncovers a new role of crowdfunding: the facilitation of learning. It suggests that feedback from financial markets, traditionally only available to listed firms, can become accessible to entrepreneurs of new ventures as early- stage financing is disintermediated by the involvement of the crowd.

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> I present a model of technology entrepreneurship in which “engineers” choose to either found a startup as an entrepreneur, pursuing a single business idea—obtaining seed funding from VCs in exchange for equity—or join an established startup as an employee. The model predicts the number of startups formed and their success probability. It also predicts the wages of engineers, the share of equity retained by founders, the fraction of engineers pursuing entrepreneurship, and the profits of successful startups. The model characterizes the total output of the entrepreneurial system and the social value of the marginal entrepreneurial venture.

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> Entrepreneurial passion has gained credence in recent years in explaining entrepreneurial efforts, yet examination of the dynamics of this emotion and its effects on venture growth is still in its infancy. Building on the literature on entrepreneurial motivation and entrepreneurial passion, we develop and test a model of entrepreneurial passion, goals, and venture growth. We utilize path analysis on a two-wave sample of founders from 122 high technology firms. We find direct positive effects of passion for developing on venture growth and an indirect positive effect mediated by goal commitment, but not goal challenge. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> In this paper, we examine five cases of technology commercialization in terms of how entrepreneurs advance a specific kind of claim: the value proposition. The value proposition can describe the characteristics of the innovation itself (Goods- Dominant Logic) or propose how the innovation will co- create value with stakeholders (Service-Dominant Logic); in the examined cases, the value proposition transitions between these two “logics,” addressing different needs in the ongoing argument. We conclude by discussing the needs that each “logic” serves and the implications for better understanding entrepreneurship communication

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> This paper seeks to apply a processual thinking of subjectivity in the study of “becoming entrepreneur”. Design/methodology/approach – Through analysing Foucault's idea of subjectification, by the help of Deleuze's comments and elaborations, the paper seeks to clarify one opacity in entrepreneurship research – the “vanishing presence” of the entrepreneur in processual studies of entrepreneurship. To avoid performative contradiction, the paper seeks to contextualise this attempt in guiding principles provided by process philosophy. Findings – Without a process view, “the subject” as entity and self-constitutive *res cogitans* (thinking thing or mind) will take priority over subjectification, and the paper will loose the possibility to think and study the process of becoming-subject in its own terms. Originality/value – Understanding entrepreneurship as organisation-creation, the paper here adds a processual conceptualisation to the study of such processes by focusing on the arrangements (*agancements* [sic] as Deleuze called this, or *dispositifs* as Foucault preferred to use) in which subjectification into “entrepreneur” happens.
