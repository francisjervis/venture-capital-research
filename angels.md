### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> We examine the interrelationship between angel and venture capital markets, using a model with free entry and search frictions. Venture capitalists rely on the supply of angel-backed deals, and angels depend on competitive valuations from venture capitalists. Ex-post, ven- ture capitalists have an incentive to hold-up angel investors, but ex-ante this may endanger their deal flow from angels. Endogenous entry limits the hold-up power of venture cap- italists. In equilibrium, angels may encourage companies to exit early, in order to avoid venture capital funding altogether. The model also explains how hold-up and competition affect the valuations paid by angels and venture capitalists.

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> We examine the relationship between angel investors and venture capitalists. Specifically we analyze how companies dynamically choose between these alternative investor types, and how these choices affect company performance. The paper juxtaposes a complements hypothesis – angel financing is a springboard for venture capital, against a substitutes hypothesis – angel financing and venture capital are distinct financing methods that do not mix well. Using a unique detailed dataset of start-ups in British Columbia, Canada, we find companies that obtain angel financing subsequently obtain less venture capital, and vice versa. On average venture capitalist makes larger investment, but this alone cannot explain the substitutes patterns. The substitutes effects are stronger for companies funded by less experienced angels. Using variation in tax credits as an exogenous instrument we find evidence for both selection and treatment effects. As for performance, companies funded by venture capital experience more successful exits than angel backed companies. However, there is no strong evidence that mixing angel and venture capital funding would be associated with significantly better or worse performance. Overall the evidence favors the substitutes hypothesis.

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> We examine the role of angel investors in early venture financing using a new sample of 182 Series A preferred stock rounds. Our sample includes deals where angels invest on their own and those where they co-invest with venture capitalists (VCs), as well as VC-only deals. We find that angels invest on their own in younger and smaller firms, where the founder retains more ownership. Control rights in these deals are also more entrepreneur-friendly. However, these firms are as likely as the VC-backed firms to have successful liquidity events, and more likely to survive, though many of the surviving firms are inactive, indicating that angels may have little incentive or limited ability to liquidate such firms. In contrast, when deals are large, we find that companies that obtain Series A financing entirely from VCs have better outcomes than those in which VCs and angels co-invest. One interpretation is that larger deal size adds power to VC syndicates, and these powerful syndicates might attempt to block other investors from higher quality deals, resulting in adverse selection for angels in larger mixed deals. Alternatively, experienced founders and VCs may prefer VC-only deals given the increased complexity of including angels, and given that angels might free ride on VCs’ managerial effort and expertise.

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> We use the angel investor market to examine the e↵ect of performance on the network con- nectedness of individual angel investors. We collect data on start-ups and angel investors from CrunchBase (www.crunchbase.com), the largest crowd-sourced database on start-ups and investors, and AngelList (www.angel.co), the leading online fund-raising platform for start-ups. We find that angels that successfully lead a portfolio company to the next fi- nancing stage, especially from seed stage to series A stage, experience an increase in both the quantity and quality of their co-investment connections relative to their unsuccessful peers, and are rewarded with more new investment opportunities, both as lead investors and as participants. Success begets more success, making it more likely that other seed-stage portfolio companies of a successful angel also progress to the next financing stage. Finally, successful performance also expands the online followership of angels, and makes it more likely that their existing followers establish a new co-investment connection. Overall, our results highlight that reputation for good performance enhances the network capital of angel investors.
