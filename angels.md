### Abstract

> Which start-up characteristics are most important to investors in early-stage firms? This paper uses a randomized field experiment involving 4,500 active, early stage investors. The experiment takes place on AngelList, an online platform that matches investors with start-ups seeking capital. The experiment randomizes investors’ information sets on start-up characteristics through the use of nearly 17,000 emails. The average investor responds strongly to information about the founding team, but not to information about either firm traction or existing lead investors. This is in contrast to the least experienced investors, who respond to all categories of information. Our results suggest that information about human assets is causally important for the funding of early-stage firms.

## Friends or Foes? The Interrelationship between Angel and Venture Capital Markets

### Summary

There is an inter-dependence between the angel and VC markets which limits the power of VCs: if VCs "hold up" angel investors, they may encourage new startups to avoid VC funding altogether.

### Abstract

> We examine the interrelationship between angel and venture capital markets, using a model with free entry and search frictions. Venture capitalists rely on the supply of angel-backed deals, and angels depend on competitive valuations from venture capitalists. Ex-post, venture capitalists have an incentive to hold-up angel investors, but ex-ante this may endanger their deal flow from angels. Endogenous entry limits the hold-up power of venture capitalists. In equilibrium, angels may encourage companies to exit early, in order to avoid venture capital funding altogether. The model also explains how hold-up and competition affect the valuations paid by angels and venture capitalists.

## Angel Investment Criteria

### Summary

Trustworthiness of the entrepreneur, quality of the management team, enthusiasm of the lead entrepreneur, and exit opportunities are angels’ top criteria for investment selection.

### Abstract

> Start-up businesses often need external financing to grow. These new ventures frequently turn to business angel investors for capital. Angels, who are often wealthy individuals, provide early stage financing, called seed capital, for these start-up ventures. This study examines what a group of angel investors in Southern California consider when reviewing an investment opportunity, and how they prioritize their investment criteria. The study utilizes a two-phase approach consisting of a qualitative first phase and a quantitative second phase. The results of this study show that trustworthiness of the entrepreneur, quality of the management team, enthusiasm of the lead entrepreneur, and exit opportunities for the angel are the angels’ top criteria.

## Angels and Venture Capitalists: Complements or Substitutes?

### Summary

Angel investment appears to substitute for VC funding: companies that obtain angel financing subsequently obtain less venture capital, and vice versa.

### Abstract

> We examine the relationship between angel investors and venture capitalists. Specifically we analyze how companies dynamically choose between these alternative investor types, and how these choices affect company performance. The paper juxtaposes a complements hypothesis – angel financing is a springboard for venture capital, against a substitutes hypothesis – angel financing and venture capital are distinct financing methods that do not mix well. Using a unique detailed dataset of start-ups in British Columbia, Canada, we find companies that obtain angel financing subsequently obtain less venture capital, and vice versa. On average venture capitalist makes larger investment, but this alone cannot explain the substitutes patterns. The substitutes effects are stronger for companies funded by less experienced angels. Using variation in tax credits as an exogenous instrument we find evidence for both selection and treatment effects. As for performance, companies funded by venture capital experience more successful exits than angel backed companies. However, there is no strong evidence that mixing angel and venture capital funding would be associated with significantly better or worse performance. Overall the evidence favors the substitutes hypothesis.

## Does Angel Participation Matter? An Analysis of Early Venture Financing

### Summary

Where angels and VCs both participate in a round, firm outcomes are worse than if just angels or just VCs invest.

### Abstract

> We examine the role of angel investors in early venture financing using a new sample of 182 Series A preferred stock rounds. Our sample includes deals where angels invest on their own and those where they co-invest with venture capitalists (VCs), as well as VC-only deals. We find that angels invest on their own in younger and smaller firms, where the founder retains more ownership. Control rights in these deals are also more entrepreneur-friendly. However, these firms are as likely as the VC-backed firms to have successful liquidity events, and more likely to survive, though many of the surviving firms are inactive, indicating that angels may have little incentive or limited ability to liquidate such firms. In contrast, when deals are large, we find that companies that obtain Series A financing entirely from VCs have better outcomes than those in which VCs and angels co-invest. One interpretation is that larger deal size adds power to VC syndicates, and these powerful syndicates might attempt to block other investors from higher quality deals, resulting in adverse selection for angels in larger mixed deals. Alternatively, experienced founders and VCs may prefer VC-only deals given the increased complexity of including angels, and given that angels might free ride on VCs’ managerial effort and expertise.

### Abstract

> We use the angel investor market to examine the effect of performance on the network connectedness of individual angel investors. We collect data on start-ups and angel investors from CrunchBase (www.crunchbase.com), the largest crowd-sourced database on start-ups and investors, and AngelList (www.angel.co), the leading online fund-raising platform for start-ups. We find that angels that successfully lead a portfolio company to the next financing stage, especially from seed stage to series A stage, experience an increase in both the quantity and quality of their co-investment connections relative to their unsuccessful peers, and are rewarded with more new investment opportunities, both as lead investors and as participants. Success begets more success, making it more likely that other seed-stage portfolio companies of a successful angel also progress to the next financing stage. Finally, successful performance also expands the online followership of angels, and makes it more likely that their existing followers establish a new co-investment connection. Overall, our results highlight that reputation for good performance enhances the network capital of angel investors.

### Abstract

> This paper documents that ventures that are funded by two successful angel groups experience superior outcomes to those that are rejected: they have improved survival, exits, employment levels, patenting, web traffic, and financing. We use strong discontinuities in the funding behavior of angels over small changes in their collective interest levels to implement a regression discontinuity approach. We confirm the positive effect of angel financing on most operations of the venture, with qualitative support for a higher likelihood of successful exits. On the other hand, there is no difference in access to additional financing around the discontinuity. This might suggest that financing is not a central input of angel groups.

### Abstract

> Recent years have seen an upsurge of novel sources of new venture financing through crowdfunding (CF). We draw on 54,943 successfully crowdfunded projects and 3,313 venture capital (VC) investments throughout the period 04/2012-06/2015 to investigate, on the aggregate level, how crowdfunding is related to a more traditional source of entrepreneurial finance, venture capital. Granger causality tests support the view that VC investments follow crowdfunding investments. Cointegration tests also suggest a long-run relationship between crowdfunding and VC investments, while impulse response functions (IRF) indicate a positive effect running from CF to VC within two to six months. Crowdfunding seems to help VC investors in assessing future trends rather than crowding them out of the market.

### Abstract

>We investigate how specific behaviors by an entrepreneur during an initial interaction with a business angel investor build, damage or violate trust, and how the investor’s changes in his or her level of trust affects the decision to make an investment offer, or not. Our empirical analysis shows that entrepreneurs who receive offers are expected to exhibit a larger number of trustbuilding behaviors, a smaller number of trust-damaging behaviors, and to be unlikely to display trust-violating behaviors, as compared to those who do not receive an offer. We further observe that the offer of a trust-repair mechanism by the investor is a prerequisite for all of the entrepreneurs who damage or violate trust to receive an investment offer.

### Abstract

> This study examines how angel investor–entrepreneur task conflicts are related to portfolio company innovativeness and how this relationship is moderated by the level of agreement on priorities, diversity of entrepreneurial experience, and the level of communication. Using survey data gathered from 54 teams of angels and entrepreneurs in Belgium and the United States, we show that the negative relationship between task conflict and innovativeness is more severe when the teams have lower levels of agreement on priorities, when there is less diversity of experience in the team, and when the teams communicate more frequently.

### Abstract

> This paper extends the literature on the investment decision-making of business angels. Using insights from entrepreneurial learning theory we explore whether angels learn from experience, how they learn and what they learn. These issues are addressed using Verbal Protocol Analysis, a methodology for examining decision-making in real time, on three groups of business angels with differing levels of investment experience, and follow-up interviews with these angels. This reveals
some differences in the speed of decision making and the emphasis given to various investment criteria. The relatively limited extent of the contrasts can be attributed to two factors. First, angel learning has been in terms of their approach to investing rather than fundamentals. Second, this learning has had more effect on how they conduct their due diligence on opportunities that pass their initial screening than on the initial screening stage itself. Learning from other investors is
important.

### Abstract

> To determine if and why entrepreneurs’ experience determines their propensity to be financed by angels, we conduct the first longitudinal analysis of the decision process of a business angel network. We code the rejection reasons recorded by the network in each file to estimate the preparedness and outcome of 636 applications. We score the entrepreneurs’ experience from their résumés. Non industry-experienced promoters have no chance of obtaining financing because of the weakness of their proposal, but are not rejected due to team weakness. We evidence several differences with the commonly accepted description of the selection process.

## Horse vs. Jockey? How stage of funding process and industry experience affect the evaluations of angel investors

### Summary

The entrepreneur matters most when angels are deciding whether a deal should proceed to due diligence; opportunity strength is more important when angels move on to determining whether a deal matches their own investment goals.

### Abstract

> Angel investors make evaluations at different stages of the funding process; so we explore how the importance angels place on different investment criteria varies and how industry experience impacts their evaluations. Data were collected at the screening stage as angel investors evaluated the strength of the entrepreneur and the opportunity, and made decisions regarding whether the deal should proceed to due diligence, as well as their personal interest in making an investment. Additional data were collected regarding whether these angels made an investment at the funding stage. We tested our hypotheses using a multilevel approach to account for the nested nature of the data – multiple evaluations nested within each angel, nested within each screening presentation. Our results show that the entrepreneur matters most when angels are deciding whether a deal should proceed to due diligence; opportunity strength represents a more important investment criterion when angels switch to determining whether a deal matches their own investment goals as the deal progresses through the funding process. Additionally, we find that three types of industry experience differ in their impact on the evaluation process. The findings offer new insights and underscore the importance of considering how individual characteristics impact evaluations of funding potential.

We give these people the name business angel gatekeepers. Guided by an analytical framework developed from the research and development literature, empirical findings are presented from a series of in-depth interviews with a representative sample of Scotland-based gatekeepers. The paper proposes a definition of the term ‘business angel gatekeeper’, identifies the function and roles of gatekeepers and examines the skills required to perform the role. The paper concludes by considering the implications for stakeholders in the business angel market.

## Angel Financing and the Performance of High-Tech Start-Ups

### Summary

Startups backed by angels with experience in early stage investments are more successful at raising follow-on VC funding; angels with later stage experience have a positive effect on exit outcomes, and firms that combine angel and VC funding do best.

### Abstract

> In this paper, we investigate what drives the performance of high-tech start-ups receiving angel financing, while taking a closer look at the capabilities (i.e., experience) and investment behavior of business angels (BAs). We exploit a new data set (extracted from Crunchbase), which consists of 1,933 high-tech start-ups that received at least one financing round from a BA. The results indicate that the experience of BAs in early stage investments is positively associated with additional receipt of follow-on rounds of financing and sequential capital injections from venture capitalists (VCs). Later-stage experience is positively associated with the start-up’s success (i.e., probability to be listed or acquired), but reduces the need for new VCs to invest in the start-up. Furthermore, we find consistent evidence that start-ups that combine BA and VC financing experience higher levels of funding amounts, additional VC financing, and an improved likelihood of success. Finally, we find that the co-localization of BA investors and start-ups in the same area facilitates the attrac- tion of VC financing.

### Abstract

> Business angel investing – a key source of finance for entrepreneurial businesses – is rapidly evolving from a fragmented and largely anonymous activity dominated by individuals investing on their own to one that is increasingly characterised by groups of investors investing together through managed angel groups. The implications of this change have been largely ignored by scholars. The paper examines the investment activity and operation of angel groups in Scotland to highlight the implications of this change for the nature of angel investing. It goes on to argue that this transformation challenges both the ongoing relevance of prior research on business angels and current methodological practices, and raises a set of new research questions.

### Abstract

> A major focus of research on business angels has examined their decision-making processes and investment criteria. As business angels reject most of the opportunities that they receive, this article explores the reasons informing such decisions. In view of angel heterogeneity, investment opportunities might be expected to be rejected for differing reasons. Two sources of data are used to examine this issue. Face-to-face interviews with 30 business angels in Scotland and Northern Ireland provided information on typical ‘deal killers’ This was complemented by an internet survey of UK that attracted responses from 238 UK business angels. The findings confirm that the main reason for rejection relates to the entrepreneur/management team. However, angel characteristics do not explain the number of reasons given for opportunity rejection nor do they predict the reasons for rejecting investment opportunities. This could be related to the increasing trend for business angels to join organized groups which, in turn, leads to the development of a shared repertoire of investment approaches. We suggest the concept of ‘communities-of-practice’ as an explanation for this finding.

## How business angel groups work: Rejection criteria in investment evaluation

### Summary

Angels are most likely to reject proposals at an early stage based on first the innovativeness of the idea (at the "pre-screening" stage), then the founding team ("screening"), with profitability a concern only at the last stage.

### Abstract

> In this article, we study the decision-making criteria that business angels (BAs) adopt when screening business opportunities in the different assessment phases (pre-screening, screening and due diligence). We exploit an original dataset of 1942 ventures that sought angel investment from 2008 to 2014 from the members of Italian Angels for Growth (IAG). Results have shown that the emphasis that BAs place on rejection criteria and contact channels varies along the three considered stages of the investment process. In particular, we found that business proposals brought to the attention of BAs by venture capitalists are more likely to get through the pre-screening stage, suggesting an important quality certification role played by venture capitalists. Moreover, at the screening stage (in comparison with the pre-screening stage), proposals are rejected more often for reasons related to the characteristics of the entrepreneur and management team and less often for the lack of business innovativeness. Finally, business proposals showing lower levels of profitability are more likely to be rejected after the due diligence.

Using a Canadian group’s archival data on 636 proposals, we provide a detailed longitudinal analysis of the decision process. The rejection reasons generally refer to market risk; this finding holds whatever the step of the process for proposals that pass the pre-screen. Angel group members focus more on market risk than agency risk, similar to venture capitalists. Inexperienced entrepreneurs are rejected for market and product reasons. Decision-making by the studied angel group members differs from that generally described for independent angels.

### Abstract

> Angel investors often make investment decisions based on motivational cues communicated during pitches – including enthusiasm, preparedness, and commitment – to evaluate potentially important qualities of entrepreneurs. We tested the independent and interaction effects of these cues by having 72 angels complete 1,995 evaluations of 133 live pitches. We found a positive effect of preparedness on angel evaluations, an effect enhanced by one form of commitment. The relationship between enthusiasm and evaluations of funding potential varies depending on the type of commitment considered. Our findings suggest that enthusiasm, preparedness, and commitment should be treated as conceptually and empirically distinct.

This study seeks to explain the individual characteristics of angel investors that influence the importance angels place on the passion displayed by the entrepreneur when angels make investment decisions. We use affective reactivity as our theoretical framework and integrate literature specific to each individual characteristic to explain how each characteristic likely impacts individuals’ affective reactivity and ultimately the importance these individuals place on passion when making investment decisions.

> This dissertation examines the effectiveness of third party affiliation signals that entrepreneurs use to convince investors to commit financial resources in an equity crowdfunding context. I investigate the importance of third party affiliation signals (business accelerators, investor syndicates, and startups featured on the equity crowdfunding platform) on subsequent online funding amounts. The data indicates that affiliation with an investor syndicate is an effective third party affiliation signal and can therefore strongly impact the probability of online funding amounts. Business accelerators and startups featured on the equity crowdfunding platform, by contrast, have little or no impact on online funding amounts. I discuss the implications of the results for theory, future research, and practice.

## Organizational Decision-Making and Information: Angel Investments by Venture Capital Partners

### Abstract

> We study information aggregation in organizational decision-making for the financing of entrepreneurial ventures. We introduce a formal model of voting where agents face costly tacit information to improve their decision quality. Equilibrium outcomes suggest a theoretical tension for group decision-making between the benefits of information aggregation and a cost from the participation of uninformed agents, and this tension presents a boundary condition for when a group decision is superior to an individual decision.

> We test the implications of the model for a particular phenomenon in venture capital: private angel investments by the partners outside of their employer, which represent investments passed on by the employer. Venture capital partners, acting independently with their personal funds, make investments into younger firms with less educated and younger founding teams than their employing VC firms, but these investments perform financially similarly or better on some metrics even when controlling for investment size, stage, and industry. Geographic distance and technological inexperience by the VC increase the probability the investment is taken up by a partner and not the VC. This work contributes to an emerging stream of literature on information aggregation in organizations and the established literatures on resource allocation and incumbent spin-outs.

### Abstract

> Investment by wealthy individuals, known as ‘angels,’ in startup firms is quite significant and has taken off in the last few years. Angels invest in the company at an earlier stage than venture capitalists (VCs) do. This paper examines the relationship between an entrepreneur, an angel, and a VC from the seed investment made by the angel to the exit stage. The study characterizes the equilibrium contracts among the players and provides insights into the related institutional arrangements. Next, the study examines the signaling aspects of the game. The paper also analyzes the moral hazard problems of the entrepreneur and the VC. It shows that the outcome in a startup firm is not efficient because of the free-rider phenomenon.
