### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> We examine the role of reputation in limiting opportunistic behavior by venture capitalists towards four types of counterparties: entrepreneurs, investors, other VCs, and buyers of VC-backed startups. Using a hand-collected database of lawsuits, we document that more reputable VCs (i.e., VCs that are older, have more deals and funds under management, and syndicate with larger networks of VCs) are less likely to be litigated. We also find that litigated VCs suffer declines in future business relative to matched peers. These declines are larger for more reputable VCs, and for VCs that are defendants to multiple lawsuits or sued by entrepreneurs.

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> Venture capitalist (VC) reputation is a valuable trait, which yields important competitive benefits. Yet a generally accepted measure is lacking. To address this need, we investigate the relation of alternative VC reputation measures to especially successful venture investments, namely IPOs and post-IPO long-run firm performance. Post-IPO firm performance is measured by three well known standards: industry-adjusted operating performance, market-to-book ratio, and long-run listing survival. We find that a VC’s market share of VC-backed IPOs has the strongest and most consistent positive association with these post-IPO long-run performance metrics and with the frequency with which a VC’s portfolio firms subsequently successfully go public. We also explore the relation between VC reputation and private equity networks, IPO demand, post-IPO VC involvement and corporate governance. We find that more reputable VCs excel on all these dimensions, which helps explain why firms backed by more reputable VCs have greater IPO success and better post-IPO performance.

## Networking as a Barrier to Entry and the Competitive Supply of Venture Capital

### Summary

The more interconnected the established players in a region's VC sector are, the harder it is for new entrants to establish themselves - making deals "cheaper" for the incumbents.

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> We examine whether strong networks among incumbent venture capitalists (VCs) in local markets help restrict entry by outside VCs, thus improving incumbents’ bargaining power over entrepreneurs. More densely networked markets experience less entry, with a one-standard deviation increase in network ties among incumbents reducing entry by approximately one-third. Entrants with established ties to target- market incumbents appear able to overcome this barrier to entry; in turn, incumbents react strategically to an increased threat of entry by freezing out any incumbents who facilitate entry into their market. Incumbents appear to benefit from reduced entry by paying lower prices for their deals.

## The cost of friendship

### Summary

VCs who share the same ethnic, educational, or career background are more likely to syndicate with each other; this gives rise to "groupthink" and worse performance.

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> We investigate how personal characteristics affect people’s desire to collaborate and whether this attraction enhances or detracts from performance in venture capital. We find that venture capitalists who share the same ethnic, educational, or career background are more likely to syndicate with each other. This homophily reduces the probability of investment success, and the detrimental effect is most prominent for early-stage investments. A variety of tests show that the cost of affinity is most likely attributable to poor decision-making by high-affinity syndicates after the investment is made. These results suggest that “birds-of-a-feather-flock-together” effects in collaboration can be costly.

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> This paper examines whether agency conflicts during venture capital (VC) fundraising im- pact investment behavior. Using novel investment-level decisions of VCs in the process of raising new funds, we find that venture capitalists take actions hidden from their investors, i.e. limited partners (LPs), that delay revealing negative information about VC fund performance until after a new fund is raised. After fundraising is complete, write-offs double and reinvestments in relatively worse off entrepreneurial firms increase. We find that these observations cannot be explained by strategic bundling of news or effort constraints due to the newly raised fund. Funds with both long and short fundraising track record exhibit this behavior and the delay is costly for fund investors (LPs). This strategic delay shows that fundraising incentives have real impacts on VC fund investment decisions, which are often difficult for LPs to observe.

## Is a VC Partnership Greater Than the Sum of Its Partners?

### Summary

The "human capital" of individual VCs is more important than their firm's organizational capital, and specific investors (even at the same firm at the same time) have recognizable differences in strategy.

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> This paper investigates whether individual venture capitalists have repeatable investment skill and to what extent their skill is impacted by the VC firm where they work. We examine a unique dataset that tracks the performance of individual venture capitalists’ investments across time and as they move between firms. We find evidence of skill and exit style differences even among venture partners investing at the same VC firm at the same time. Furthermore, our estimates suggest the partner’s human capital is two to five times more important than the VC firm’s organizational capital in explaining performance.

## Founder Replacement and Startup Performance

### Summary

When VCs replace startup founders, they improve the performance of their portfolios - particularly when they replace them with executives with substantial industry experience.

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> We provide causal evidence that venture capitalists (VCs) improve the performance of their portfolio companies by replacing founders. Augmenting a database of U.S.- based, VC-backed startups from 1995–2008 with hand-collected information regarding turnover, we exploit shocks to the supply of outside executives via state-level changes in the enforceability of employee non-compete agreements. Although naive regressions of startup performance on founder replacement would suggest a negative correlation, this may be due to selection as founders are likely to leave or be pushed out of poorly-performing startups. Indeed, instrumented regressions reverse the sign of this effect, suggesting that replacing founders improves the performance of venture-backed entrepreneurial firms. Replacement helps more when founders hold CXO roles and when the incoming replacement has substantial work experience. The evidence points to the replacement of founders as a specific mechanism by which VCs add value.

## Venture Capital Valuation, Partial Adjustment, and Underpricing: Behavioral Bias or Information Production?

### Summary

Perceived valuation change from the last pre-IPO VC round to the IPO affects IPO underpricing in a nonlinear way.

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> Using a sample of venture capital (VC)-backed initial public offerings (IPOs), we analyze the role played by perceived valuation changes on IPO underpricing. We find that perceived valuation change from the last pre-IPO VC round to the IPO affects IPO underpricing in a nonlinear way. Further analysis indicates that information-based theories, not behavioral biases, explain this nonlinearity. We also find that the previously documented partial adjustment effect and its nonlinear impact on IPO underpricing are related to the trajectory of the perceived valuation changes, which stands in stark contrast to prior evidence of the importance of behavioral biases.

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> Sociological investigations of economic exchange reveal how institutions and social structures shape transaction patterns among economic actors. This article explores how interfirm networks in the U.S. venture capital (VC) market affect spatial patterns of exchange. Evidence suggests that information about potential investment opportunities generally circulates within geographic and industry spaces. In turn, the circumscribed flow of information within these spaces contributes to the geographic- and industry-localization of VC investments. Empirical analyses demonstrate that the social networks in the VC community — built up through the industry’s extensive use of syndicated investing — diffuse information across boundaries and therefore expand the spatial radius of exchange. Venture capitalists that build axial positions in the industry’s coinvestment network invest more frequently in spatially distant companies. Thus, variation in actors’ positioning within the structure of the market appears to differentiate market participants’ ability to overcome boundaries that otherwise would curtail exchange.

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> An important type of product differentiation in the venture capital (VC) market is industry specialization. We estimate a market structure model to assess competition among VCs — some of which specialize in a particular industry and others of which are generalists — and find that the incremental effect of additional same-type competitors increases as the number of same-type competitors increases. Furthermore, we find that the effects of generalist VCs on specialists are substantial, and larger than the effect of same-type competitors. Estimates from other industries typically show the incremental effects falling as the number of same-type competitors increases and the effects of same-type competitors as always being larger than the effects of different-type competitors. Consistent with the presence of network effects that soften competition, these patterns are more pronounced in markets that exhibit dense organizational networks among incumbent VCs. Markets with sparser incumbent networks, by contrast, exhibit competitive patterns that resemble those of other, non-networked industries.

### <summary>Abstract</summary>

> This study argues and demonstrates that the value of a venture’s affiliations depends in part on its relative standing in the portfolio of affiliations held by its partners. Relative standing refers to how the venture ranks among other ventures in the partner’s portfolio with respect to observable signals of quality. The relative standing of a venture in its partner’s portfolio influences the venture’s access to the partner’s resources and, subsequently, the venture’s performance. We
also argue that a venture’s relative standing becomes a more important predictor of performance when the partner has a larger portfolio or higher status. An empirical test of the equity investments by venture capital firms in 878 private biotechnology ventures between 1980 and 2004 provides support for the hypotheses.
