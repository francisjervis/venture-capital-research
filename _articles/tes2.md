title: "Attracting Early Stage Investors: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment"
excerpt: "Inexperienced angel investors are influenced by all kinds of information about a startup, but more experienced investors only care about the founding team."

abstract: Which start-up characteristics are most important to investors in early-stage firms? This paper uses a randomized field experiment involving 4,500 active, early stage investors. The experiment takes place on AngelList, an online platform that matches investors with start-ups seeking capital. The experiment randomizes investorsâ€™ information sets on start-up characteristics through the use of nearly 17,000 emails. The average investor responds strongly to information about the founding team, but not to information about either firm traction or existing lead investors. This is in contrast to the least experienced investors, who respond to all categories of information. Our results suggest that information about human assets is causally important for the funding of early-stage firms.
