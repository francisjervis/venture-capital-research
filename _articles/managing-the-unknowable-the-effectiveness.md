abstract: Based on an inductive theory-development study, a field experiment, and a longitudinal field test, we examine early-stage entrepreneurial investment decision making under conditions of extreme uncertainty. Building on existing literature on decision making and risk in organizations, intuition, and theories of entrepreneurial financing, we test the effectiveness of angel investors’ criteria for making investment decisions. We use this prior work as an integrated lens to ground our empirical findings, and discover that angel investors’ decisions have several characteristics that have not been adequately captured in existing theory: angel investors have clear objectives (extraordinarily profitable investments rather than seeking to maximize return on each investment), and they rely on a combination of expertise-based intuition and formal analysis in which intuition trumps analysis, contrary to reports in other investment contexts. We also found, as proposed, that their reported emphasis on assessments of the entrepreneur accurately predict extraordinarily profitable venture success four years later. We develop this theory by examining situations in which uncertainty is so extreme that it qualifies as unknowable and propose using the term of art, “gut feel,” to describe their dynamic emotion-cognitions in which they blend analysis and intuition in ways that do not impair intuitive processes, and in turn, effectively predict extraordinarily profitable investments.
