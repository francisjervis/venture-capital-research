abstract: "We examine the relationship between angel investors and venture capitalists. Specifically we analyze how companies dynamically choose between these alternative investor types, and how these choices affect company performance. The paper juxtaposes a complements hypothesis – angel financing is a springboard for venture capital, against a substitutes hypothesis – angel financing and venture capital are distinct financing methods that do not mix well. Using a unique detailed dataset of start-ups in British Columbia, Canada, we find companies that obtain angel financing subsequently obtain less venture capital, and vice versa. On average venture capitalist makes larger investment, but this alone cannot explain the substitutes patterns. The substitutes effects are stronger for companies funded by less experienced angels. Using variation in tax credits as an exogenous instrument we find evidence for both selection and treatment effects. As for performance, companies funded by venture capital experience more successful exits than angel backed companies. However, there is no strong evidence that mixing angel and venture capital funding would be associated with significantly better or worse performance. Overall the evidence favors the substitutes hypothesis."
