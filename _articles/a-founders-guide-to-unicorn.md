title: A Founder's Guide to Unicorn Creation\: How Liquidation Preferences in M&A Transactions Affect Start-Up Valuation

excerpt: Unicorn valuations are unreliable measures for firm value for the same reason that all start-up valuations are unreliable measures of firm value — namely, the common practice among VC investors to price VC financings as if they are purchasing common stock when they are acquiring preferred stock with downside economic protections.

abstract: This chapter, written for a Research Handbook on Mergers and Acquisitions (Davidoff-Solomon & Hill, eds.), investigates the widespread claim that the billion dollar valuations of “unicorn” start-ups are unreliable because of the manner in which founders bargain for these valuations with their venture capital (VC) investors. In particular, unicorn skeptics posit that VC investors agree to use these valuations in exchange for receiving enhanced preferred stock preferences, particularly enhanced liquidation preferences that are payable on a sale of the company.
