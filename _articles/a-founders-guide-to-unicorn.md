title: A Founder's Guide to Unicorn Creation: How Liquidation Preferences in M&A Transactions Affect Start-Up Valuation

authors:

    affiliation: University of California, Berkeley
abstract: This chapter, written for a Research Handbook on Mergers and Acquisitions (Davidoff-Solomon & Hill, eds.), investigates the widespread claim that the billion dollar valuations of “unicorn” start-ups are unreliable because of the manner in which founders bargain for these valuations with their venture capital (VC) investors. In particular, unicorn skeptics posit that VC investors agree to use these valuations in exchange for receiving enhanced preferred stock preferences, particularly enhanced liquidation preferences that are payable on a sale of the company.
