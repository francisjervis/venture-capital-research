abstract: This paper seeks to apply a processual thinking of subjectivity in the study of “becoming entrepreneur”. Design/methodology/approach – Through analysing Foucault's idea of subjectification, by the help of Deleuze's comments and elaborations, the paper seeks to clarify one opacity in entrepreneurship research – the “vanishing presence” of the entrepreneur in processual studies of entrepreneurship. To avoid performative contradiction, the paper seeks to contextualise this attempt in guiding principles provided by process philosophy. Findings – Without a process view, “the subject” as entity and self-constitutive *res cogitans* (thinking thing or mind) will take priority over subjectification, and the paper will loose the possibility to think and study the process of becoming-subject in its own terms. Originality/value – Understanding entrepreneurship as organisation-creation, the paper here adds a processual conceptualisation to the study of such processes by focusing on the arrangements (*agancements* [sic] as Deleuze called this, or *dispositifs* as Foucault preferred to use) in which subjectification into “entrepreneur” happens.
