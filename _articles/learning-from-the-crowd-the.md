abstract: "Entrepreneurship is characterized by high failure rates and extreme uncertainty. In light of this, entrepreneurs’ learning about potential returns at an early stage is essential to their entry and allocation of resources. This paper uses the crowdfunding market to provide direct micro-level evidence on entrepreneurial learning. I find that entrepreneurs update beliefs based on feedbacks from the crowd in ways consistent with a simple Bayesian learning model, placing more weight on information with relatively higher precision. Moreover, entrepreneurs make entry and project choice decisions based on what they learned. Over time, learning improves an entrepreneur’s funding outcomes and reduces her likelihood of switching projects. I further establish the learning advantage of crowdfunding using local housing price movements and small business loan supply shocks as changes to the relative cost of crowdfunding vis-à-vis bank borrowing. I find that, as crowdfunding becomes relatively more costly, entrepreneurs choosing crowdfunding face higher uncertainty ex-ante and engage in more learning ex-post. My paper uncovers a new role of crowdfunding: the facilitation of learning. It suggests that feedback from financial markets, traditionally only available to listed firms, can become accessible to entrepreneurs of new ventures as early- stage financing is disintermediated by the involvement of the crowd."
