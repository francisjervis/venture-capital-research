abstract: Start-up businesses often need external financing to grow. These new ventures frequently turn to business angel investors for capital. Angels, who are often wealthy individuals, provide early stage financing, called seed capital, for these start-up ventures. This study examines what a group of angel investors in Southern California consider when reviewing an investment opportunity, and how they prioritize their investment criteria. The study utilizes a two-phase approach consisting of a qualitative first phase and a quantitative second phase. The results of this study show that trustworthiness of the entrepreneur, quality of the management team, enthusiasm of the lead entrepreneur, and exit opportunities for the angel are the angels’ top criteria.
