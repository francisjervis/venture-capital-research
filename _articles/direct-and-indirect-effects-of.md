abstract: Entrepreneurial passion has gained credence in recent years in explaining entrepreneurial efforts, yet examination of the dynamics of this emotion and its effects on venture growth is still in its infancy. Building on the literature on entrepreneurial motivation and entrepreneurial passion, we develop and test a model of entrepreneurial passion, goals, and venture growth. We utilize path analysis on a two-wave sample of founders from 122 high technology firms. We find direct positive effects of passion for developing on venture growth and an indirect positive effect mediated by goal commitment, but not goal challenge. Implications for research and practice are discussed.
