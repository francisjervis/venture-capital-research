abstract: How to valuate accurately a new venture is a critical and under-researched question in entrepreneurial financing. Leveraging established theories in strategic management, this research study develops an integrative theoretical framework to examine whether venture capitalistsâ€™ valuation of a new venture can be explained by variables identified in the strategy literature as important to predicting firm-level economic performance. A systematic linkage between well-developed theories in strategy and venture capital valuation practice are corroborated empirically. This research study proposes a complementary method to extant valuation methods to valuate a new venture.
